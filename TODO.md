 * z position
 * export to SVG, loading from SVG

Bugs:
  * double click enters text editing only in draw mode, not in text mode

Done:
 * when clicking, more than one path is created, with short "stubs" with
   just a single point.
 * something weird is happening with colors when copying and pasting
   - instead of pasting the object, we paste the image generated from the
     object. *And* something weird is happening with the colors!
 * copy and paste groups and paths
 * grouping
