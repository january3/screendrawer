 * undo
 * z position
 * export to SVG, loading from SVG
 * turn it into a Gnome plugin

Bugs:
 * something weird is happening with colors when copying and pasting
   - instead of pasting the object, we paste the image generated from the
     object. *And* something weird is happening with the colors!
 * when clicking, more than one path is created, with short "stubs" with
   just a single point.

Done:
 * copy and paste groups and paths
 * grouping
